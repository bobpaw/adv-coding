# adv-coding
A repo of the Kealing Advanced Coding course work.
## Style Guide
See `example.txt` for how to begin code comments
When naming files, only alphanumeric characters, `-`, `.`, and `_`.
I swear, never every name something `Turtle Fun!.py` with a space and exclamation mark.
Try to keep line lengths limited to 80 in code.
Convert all tabs to spaces.
Use CRLF for compatibility where possible
